# Exploratory data science & machine learning projects

This repository contains a collection of small, independent exploratory projects
developed for learning and experimentation with data analysis, machine learning,
and scientific computing techniques.

The projects focus on implementing standard workflows (data preprocessing,
modeling, evaluation, and visualization) rather than producing deployable systems.

---

## Contents

The repository includes experiments such as:
- Regression and classification models using NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn
- End-to-end machine learning pipelines (scaling, rebalancing, training, validation)
- Exploratory analysis of scientific datasets (e.g. high-energy telescope data)
- Introductory neural network experiments using TensorFlow and PyTorch

Each project is contained in a separate script or notebook and can be read
independently.

---

## Data Availability

The original datasets used during experimentation are **not included** in this
repository due to availability, licensing, or archival limitations.

The code is preserved to demonstrate:
- modeling logic
- preprocessing steps
- evaluation methodology
- overall experimental workflow

Where relevant, the expected data format can be inferred from the code.

## Purpose and Scope

These projects were developed as part of self-directed learning and academic
practice. Results should be interpreted as exploratory rather than benchmarked
or production-validated.

This repository is intended to showcase technical familiarity with common tools
and workflows in data science and machine learning.

## Requirements

Typical dependencies include:
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / PyTorch 

Exact requirements may vary by project.

## Notes

This repository complements other, fully reproducible projects hosted separately.
